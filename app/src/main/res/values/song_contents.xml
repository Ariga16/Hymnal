Only good and only true.\n
God unknown, He alone\n
Calls my heart to be His own.\n

High on His heart He will bear it for thee,\n
Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness,\n
Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.\n

Fear not to enter His courts in the slenderness\n
Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine;\n
Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness,\n
These are the offerings to lay on His shrine.\n

4\n
These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,\n
He will accept for the name that is dear;\n
Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,\n
Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.\n

Sing a new song to the Lord,\n
He to whom wonders belong.\n
Rejoice in His triumph and tell of His power.\n
O sing a new song to the Lord.\n

Now to the ends of the earth\n
See His salvation is shown.\n
And still He remembers His mercy and truth,\n
Unchanging in love to His own.\n

Sing a new song and rejoice.\n
Publish His praises abroad.\n
Let voices in chorus with trumpet and horn,\n
Resound for the joy of the Lord.\n

Wake the song of joy and gladness;\n
Hither bring your noblest lays;\n
Banish every thought of sadness,\n
Pouring forth your highest praise.\n
Sing to Him whose care has brought us\n
Once again with friends to meet,\n
And whose loving voice has taught us\n
Of the way to Jesus’ feet.\n

Wake the song, wake the song,\n
The song of joy and gladness,\n
Wake the song, wake the song,\n
The song of Jubilee.\n

Joyfully with songs and banners,\n
We will greet the festal day;\n
Shout aloud our glad hosannas,\n
And our grateful homage pay.\n
We will chant our Savior’s glory\n
While our thoughts we raise above,\n
Telling still the old, old, story,\n
Precious theme—redeeming love!\n

3\n
Thanks to Thee, O holy Father,\n
For the mercies of the year;\n
May each heart, as here we gather,\n
Swell with gratitude sincere.\n
Thanks to Thee, O loving Savior,\n
For redemption through Thy blood.\n
Breathe upon us, Holy Spirit,\n
Sweetly draw us near to God.\n

With songs and honors sounding loud,\n
Address the Lord on high;\n
Over the heavens He spreads His cloud,\n
And waters veil the sky.\n

2\n
He sends His showers of blessing down\n
To cheer the plains below;\n
He makes the grass the mountains crown,\n
And corning valleys grow.\n

3\n
His steady counsels change the face\n
Of the declining year;\n
He bids the sun cut short his race,\n
And wintry days appear.\n

4\n
He sends His word, and melts the snow;\n
The fields no longer mourn;\n
He calls the warmer gales to blow,\n
And bids the spring return.\n

5\n
The changing wind, the flying cloud,\n
Obey His mighty word:\n
With songs and honors sounding loud\n
Praise ye the sovereign Lord!\n

O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,\n
On whom in affliction I call,\n
My comfort by day and my song in the night,\n
My hope, my salvation, my all!\n

2\n
His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,\n
Is heard through the shadows of death;\n
The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,\n
The air is perfumed with His breath.\n

3\n
His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,\n
To water the gardens of grace;\n
From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,\n
And bask in the smiles of His face.\n

4\n
He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,\n
And myriads wait for His word;\n
He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,\n
Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.\n

            <item>
O sing my soul, your Maker’s praise\n
In grateful hymns ascending;\n
Whose steadfast love has crowned your days\n
With heav’nly gifts unending.\n

His holy angels hover nigh\n
The tents of those who love Him.\n

2\n
The Lord is good to those who seek\n
His face in time of sorrow,\n
Providing comfort to the weak\n
And grace for each tomorrow.\n
Though grief may tarry for a night,\n
The morn shall break in joy and light\n
With blessings from His presence.\n

3\n
The Lord will turn His face in peace\n
When troubled souls draw near Him;\n
His loving kindness shall not cease\n
To those who trust and fear Him.\n
Our God will not forsake His own;\n
Eternal is His heav’nly throne;\n
His kingdom stands forever.\n

Arise, my soul, arise!\n
Stretch forth to things eternal\n
And hasten to the feet of your Redeemer God.\n
Though hid from mortal eyes,\n
He dwells in light supernal;\n
Yet worship Him in humbleness and call Him Lord.\n

His banquet of love\n
Awaits you above;\n
Yet here He grants a foretaste of the feast\n
to come!\n
Rejoice, my soul, rejoice,\n
To heav’n lift up your voice:\n
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n

2\n
Now hear the harps of heav’n!\n
Oh, hear the song victorious,\n
The never-ending anthem sounding\n
through the sky!\n
To mortals is not giv’n\n
To join in strains so glorious;\n

Yet here on earth we too can sing\n
our praises high!\n
He bought with His blood\n
The ransomed of God;\n
To Him be everlasting pow’r and victory.\n
And let the great amen\n
Resound through heav’n again.\n
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!\n

Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear\n
My voice ascending high;\n
To Thee will I direct my prayer,\n
To Thee lift up mine eye-\n

2\n
Up to the hills where Christ is gone\n
To plead for all His saints,\n
Presenting at His Father’s throne\n
Our songs and our complaints.\n

3\n
O may Thy Spirit guide my feet\n
In ways of righteousness;\n
Make every path of duty straight\n
And plain before my face.\n

The men that love and fear Thy name\n
Shall see their hopes fulfilled;\n
The mighty God will compass them\n
With favor as a shield.\n

The dawn of God’s dear Sabbath\n
Breaks o’er the earth again,\n
As some sweet summer morning\n
After a night of pain;\n
It comes as cooling showers\n
To some exhausted land,\n
As shade of clustered palm trees\n
‘Mid weary wastes of sand.\n

2\n
Lord, we would bring for offering,\n
Though marred with earthly soil,\n
A week of earnest labor,\n
Of steady, faithful toil,\n
Fair fruits of self denial,\n
Of strong, deep love to Thee,\n
Fostered by Thine own Spirit,\n
In true humility.\n

3\n
And we would bring our burden\n
Of sinful thought and deed,\n
In Thy pure presence kneeling,\n
From bondage to be freed,\n
Our heart’s most bitter sorrow\n
For all Thy work undone-\n
So many talents wasted!\n
So few bright laurels won!\n

4\n
And with that sorrow mingling,\n
A steadfast faith, and sure,\n
And love so deep and fervent,\n
For Thee to make it pure,\n
In Thy dear presence finding\n
The pardon that we need,\n
And then the peace so lasting-\n
Celestial peace indeed.\n

O splendor of God’s glory bright,\n
From light eternal bringing light;\n
O Light of life, light’s living spring,\n
True day, all days illumining.\n

2\n
O Thou true Sun, on us Thy glance\n
Let fall in royal radiance;\n
The Spirit’s sanctifying beam\n
Upon our earthly senses stream.\n

3\n
O joyful be the passing day\n
With thoughts as clear as morning’s ray,\n
With faith like noontide shining bright,\n
Our souls unshadowed by the night.\n

4\n
Dawn’s glory gilds the earth and skies;\n
Let Him, our perfect morn, arise;\n
The Father’s help His children claim,\n
And sing the Father’s glorious name. Amen.\n

Now that the daylight fills the sky,\n
We lift our hearts to God on high,\n
That He, in all we do or say,\n
Would keep us free from harm today;\n

2\n
Would guard our hearts and tongues from strife;\n
From anger’s din would shield our life;\n
From evil sights would turn our eyes,\n
And close our ears to vanities;\n

3\n
So we, when this new day is gone\n
And night in turn is drawing on,\n
With conscience by the world unstained\n
Shall praise His name for vict’ry gained.\n

4\n
“All praise to You, creator Lord!\n
All praise to You, eternal Word!\n
All praise to You, O Spirit wise!”\n

May Jesus Christ be praised!\n
O hark to what it sings, as joyously it rings,\n
May Jesus Christ be praised!\n

The night becomes as day when from the heart we say:\n
May Jesus Christ be praised!\n
The powers of darkness fear when this sweet chant they hear:\n
May Jesus Christ be praised!\n

Ye nations of mankind, in this your concord find,\n
May Jesus Christ be praised!\n
Let all the earth around ring joyous with the sound,\n
May Jesus Christ be praised!\n

In heaven’s eternal bliss the loveliest strain is this,\n
May Jesus Christ be praised!\n
Let earth, and sea and sky from depth to height reply,\n

Zion, let me enter there,\n
Where my soul in joyful duty\n
Waits for God Who answers prayer.\n

Filled with solace, light, and grace!\n

Gracious God, I come before Thee,\n
Come Thou also unto me;\n
Where we find Thee and adore Thee,\n
There a heav’n on earth must be.\n
To my heart, oh, enter Thou,\n
Let it be Thy temple now!\n

Here Thy praise is gladly chanted,\n
Here Thy seed is duly sown;\n
Let my soul, where it is planted,\n
Bring forth precious sheaves alone,\n
So that all I hear may be\n
Fruitful unto life in me.\n

4\n
Thou my faith increase and quicken,\n
Let me keep Thy gift divine,\n
Howsoe’er temptations thicken;\n
May Thy Word still o’er me shine\n
As my guiding star through life,\n
As my comfort in my strife.\n

5\n
Speak, O God, and I will hear Thee,\n
Let Thy will be done indeed;\n
May I undisturbed draw near Thee\n
While Thou dost Thy people feed.\n
Here of life the fountain flows;\n
Here is balm for all our woes.\n

Abide with me, ’tis eventide!\n
And lone will be the night,\n
If I cannot commune with Thee,\n
Nor find in Thee my light.\n

God, who made the earth and heaven, Darkness and light:\n
You the day for work have given, For rest the night.\n
May Your angel guards defend us,\n
Slumber sweet Your mercy send us,\n
Holy dreams and hopes attend us\n
All through the night.\n

2\n
And when morn again shall call us to run life’s way,\n
May we still, what-e’er befall us, Your will obey.\n
From the pow’r of evil hide us,\n
In the narrow pathway guide us,\n
Never be Your smile denied us\n
All through the day.\n

3\n
Guard us waking, guard us sleeping, And, when we die,\n
May we in Your mighty keeping All peaceful lie.\n
When the trumpet call shall wake us, Then,\n
O Lord, do not forsake us,\n
But to reign in glory take us with You on high.\n

Holy Father, throned in heaven, All holy Son,\n

Thou, whose all-pervading eye\n
Nought escapes, without, within,\n
Pardon each infirmity,\n
Open fault, and secret sin.\n

Soon from us the light of day\n
Shall forever pass away;\n
Then, from sin and sorrow free,\n
Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.\n

            <item>
Savior, breathe an evening blessing,\n
Ere repose our spirits seal;\n
Sin and want we come confessing;\n

Though the night be dark and dreary,\n
Darkness cannot hide from Thee;\n
Thou art He who, never weary,\n
Watchest where Thy people be.\n

3\n
Though destruction walk around us,\n
Though the arrow past us fly,\n
Angel guards from Thee surround us,\n
We are safe if Thou art nigh.\n

4\n
Should swift death this night o’er-take us,\n
And our couch become our tomb,\n
May the morn of glory wake us,\n
Clad in light and deathless bloom.\n

The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide!\n
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,\n
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.\n

Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;\n
Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away;\n
Change and decay in all around I see;\n
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.\n

I need Thy presence every passing hour.\n
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?\n
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?\n
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.\n

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;\n
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.\n
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?\n
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!\n

Heart of love enfolding all,\n

Of the stars that veil Thy face,\n

Pass the stars, the day, the night,\n

Sleep that may me more vigorous make\n

Faithful love serves to prove\n

How to use this house of prayer:\n

Whirling amid the suns of space;\n
We are God’s children, this our home,\n
With those of every clime and race.\n

O world of man where life is lived,\n
So strangely mingling joy and pain,\n
So full of evil and of good,\n
So needful that the god shall reign!\n
It is this world that God has loved,\n
And goodness was its Maker’s plan,\n
The promise of God’s triumph is\n
His coming in a Son of Man.\n

There was a day when time stood still,\n
A central moment when there rose\n

The wisdom of the ways of God,\n
The grace through which man’s hurt is healed.\n

Without love I am no better,\n
Without love it’s all for naught;\n
Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:\n
What this means I would be taught.\n

Love is patient, knows no envy,\n
Never gloats when others sin;\n
Love is never glad to see injustice,\n

There’s no test it cannot face;\n
Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:\n
I shall fail without Your grace.\n

High as the heavens our voices raise;\n
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,\n

His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,\n

Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?\n
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;\n
It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,\n
And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.\n

O little town of Bethlehem,\n
How still we see thee lie!\n

The silent stars go by;\n
Yet in thy dark streets shineth\n
The everlasting light;\n
The hopes and fears of all the years\n

The dear Christ enters in.\n

Once in royal David\'s city\n
Stood a lowly cattle shed,\n
Where a mother laid her Baby\n
In a manger for His bed;\n
Mary was that mother mild,\n
Jesus Christ her little Child.\n

He came down to earth from heaven\n
Who is God and Lord of all,\n
And His shelter was a stable,\n
And His cradle was a stall;\n
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,\n
Lived on earth our Savior holy.\n

3\n
And through all His wondrous childhood\n
He would honor and obey,\n
Love and watch the lowly mother\n
In whose gentle arms He lay.\n
Christian children all must be\n
Mild, obedient, good as He.\n

4\n
And our eyes at last shall see Him,\n
Through His own redeeming love;\n
For that Child so dear and gentle\n
Is our Lord in heaven above;\n
And He leads His children on\n
To the place where He is gone.\n

One staff and one rod,\n
One fold and one God;\n

my great Redeemer’s praise,\n
the glories of my God and King,\n

assist me to proclaim,\n

Jesus! the name that charms our fears,\n
that bids our sorrows cease;\n
’tis music in the sinner’s ears,\n

He breaks the power of canceled sin,\n
he sets the prisoner free;\n
his blood can make the foulest clean;\n
his blood availed for me.\n

He speaks, and listening to his voice,\n
new life the dead receive;\n
the mournful, broken hearts rejoice,\n

Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,\n
your loosened tongues employ;\n
ye blind, behold your savior come,\n
and leap, ye lame, for joy.

And tho’ my heart grows weary\n

To cleanse from every sinful stain,\n
And make us kings and priests to God:\n

I cannot tell why He whom angels worship\n
Should set His love upon the souls of men,\n
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers,\n
To bring them back, they know not how nor when.\n
But this I know, that He was born of Mary\n
When Bethlehem’s manger was His only home,\n
And that He lived at Nazareth and laboured;\n
And so the Saviour, Saviour of the world, has come.\n

2\n
I cannot tell how silently He suffered\n
As with His peace He graced this place of tears,\n
Nor how His heart upon the cross was broken,\n
The crown of pain to three and thirty years.\n
But this I know He heals the broken hearted\n
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear,\n
And lifts the burden from the heavy laden;\n
For still the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is here.\n

3\n
I cannot tell how He will win the nations,\n
How He will claim His earthly heritage,\n
How satisfy the needs and aspirations\n
Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.\n
But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,\n
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,\n
And some glad day His sun will shine in splendour\n
When He the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is known.\n

4\n
I cannot tell how all lands shall worship,\n
When at His bidding every storm is stilled,\n
Or who can say how great the jubilation\n
When all our hearts with love for Him are filled.\n
But this I know the skies shall sound His praises,\n
Ten thousand thousand human voices sing,\n
And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth will answer,\n
At last the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is King!\n

Till all the ransomed church of God are saved, to sin no more.\n
Are saved, to sin no more, are saved, to sin no more;\n

For me a blood-bought free reward, a golden harp for me!\n

There in a nobler, sweeter song, I’ll sing Thy power to save,\n
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue is ransomed from the grave.\n
Is ransomed from the grave, is ransomed from the grace;\n
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue is ransomed from the grave.\n

Give of thine own to bear the message glorious;\n
Give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;\n
Pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;\n
O Zion, haste to bring the brighter day.\n
[Refrain]\n

4\n
He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him,\n
Make known to every heart His saving grace;\n
Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,\n
Through thy neglect, unfit to see His face.\n

O where are the reapers that garner in\n
The sheaves of the good from the fields of sin?\n
With sickles of truth must the work be done,\n
And no one may rest till the “harvest home.”\n

Refrain\n
Where are the reapers? O who will come\n
And share in the glory of the “harvest home”?\n
O who will help us to garner in\n
The sheaves of good from the fields of sin?\n

2\n
The fields all are ripening, and far and wide\n
The world now is waiting the harvest tide:\n
But reapers are few, and the work is great,\n
And much will be lost should the harvest wait.\n
[Refrain]\n

3\n
So come with your sickles, ye sons of men,\n
And gather together the golden grain;\n
Toil on till the Lord of the harvest come,\n
Then share ye His joy in the “harvest home.”\n

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,\n
snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;\n
weep o’er the erring one, lift up the fallen,\n
tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.\n

Refrain\n
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;\n
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.\n

2\n
Though they are slighting him, still he is waiting,\n
waiting the penitent child to receive;\n
plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;\n
he will forgive if they only believe.\n
[Refrain]\n

3\n
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;\n
strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;\n
back to the narrow way patiently win them;\n
tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.\n

Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,\n
Every soul a warning give;\n
Whosoever hears the message\n
May repent, and, turn and live.\n

Refrain\n
Blow the trumpet, trusty watchman,\n
Blow it loud o’er land and sea;\n
God commissions, sound the message!\n
Every captive may be free.\n

2\n
Sound it loud o’er every hilltop,\n
Gloomy shade and sunny plain;\n
Ocean depths repeat the message,\n
Full salvation’s glad refrain.\n
[Refrain]\n

3\n
Sound it in the hedge and highway,\n
Earth’s dark spots where exiles roam;\n
Let it tell all things are ready,\n
Father waits to welcome home.\n
[Refrain]\n

4\n
Sound it for the heavy laden,\n
Weary, longing to be free;\n
Sound a Savior’s invitation,\n
Sweetly saying, “Come to me.”\n

Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,\n
Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve,\n
Waiting for the harvest and the time of reaping –\n
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.\n

Refrain\n
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,\n
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.\n
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,\n
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.\n

2\n
Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,\n
Fearing neither clouds nor winter’s chilling breeze;\n
By and by the harvest and the labor ended –\n
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.\n
[Refrain]\n

3\n
Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,\n
Though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;\n
When our weeping’s over He will bid us welcome –\n
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.\n

Christ for the world we sing,\n
the world to Christ we bring,\n
with loving zeal;\n
the poor, and them that mourn,\n
the faint and overborne,\n
sin-sick and sorrow-worn,\n
whom Christ doth heal.\n

Christ for the world we sing,\n
the world to Christ we bring,\n
with fervent prayer;\n
the wayward and the lost,\n
by restless passions tossed,\n
redeemed at countless cost,\n
from dark despair.\n

Christ for the world we sing,\n
the world to Christ we bring,\n
with joyful song;\n
the newborn souls, whose days,\n
reclaimed from error’s ways,\n
inspired with hope and praise,\n
to Christ belong.\n
